---- version 0.3 ------------------------  
* 04b2de1 Client code no longer has to import atomic::Ordering
* 5a3547a Improved referece rules.    
Requiring a mutable Component reference in order to get a mutable trait
reference is too limiting and not neccesary so now you can get multiple
mutable trait refs as long as they are different traits while using an
immutable Component ref.

Though this isn't quite right: the check should be that the traits
are on different objects not that they are different traits.
* 23faa1c Outstanding references are now tracked per object not per trait
* 6f3f87a Moved TypeErasedPointer into its own file
* 71ebb84 Added a comment

---- version 0.2 ------------------------  
* a1c37c5 Updated for the crate name changing from gear to gear-objects
* 21185a5 Added change history file
* 67b72e7 Components are now Send + Sync.
Note that there is now a requirement that Object's be Send + Sync.
Additionally find_mut now takes a mutable Component reference so
that two threads cannot get two mutable trait references.
* ed4b2bd Added use declarations to example in readme
* 28b09a9 Bumped minor version to account for breaking changes

---- version 0.1.0 ------------------------
* initial release
